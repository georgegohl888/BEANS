# BEANS
BEANS stands for the Bean Export Ariel Navigation System.
# What does it do?
The BEANS aims to produce a fully autonomous bean delivery platform to satisfy Danny and his love for beans no matter where he is.
# Development plan
The project has bean (ha!) broken down into 5 key steps.
 1. Full manual Bean delivery.
    This stage is primarily about building the aircraft to deliver the beans. At this stage the aircraft is expected to be able to carry 1     tin of heinz beans. It will have a wingspan of around 2m and have a twin electric motor configuration.
    This stage will conclude with a flight to drop a tin of beans manualy.
    
 2. Autopilot.
    This stage is about starting to develop the avionics for the aircraft. This step has a few phases of development. Firstly a simple         attitude hold system should be implement and will be the backbone of the system. Using an imu the aircraft should be able to control       pitch, roll and yaw and automatically stay level. Once this is done altitude and gps can be integrated to allow a route to be followed.
    
 3. Automatic Bean Release (ABR).
    This stage aims to automate the release of the beans. Using a pre programmed location the aircraft should be able to line up with the       target and calculate the release to drop the beans accuratley onto dannys plate.
    
 4. Full autonomous bean action.
    This stage aims to create a fully autonomous platforms including take-off, bean delivery and landing.
    
 5. Search and deliver.
    The final goal of the project is to include a system to locate where danny is and deliver the beans without any previous knowlege of       his location.
