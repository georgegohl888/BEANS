#intro

An important part of any airborne project is the aircraft itself. Without it it is little mor ethan a pile of wires and circuit boards.

#Design considerations

Before i started to crack on an make the thing i need tome idea of what i needed to make. A standard tin of beans weighs in at a 
whopping 415 grams so careful planning needs to be done to ensure the thing will get of the ground. 

Wingspan

It was decided to to use a wingspan of just under 2 meters. This large wingspan means we have the neccicary lift to carry the payload 
and also gives us natural stability. This large wingspan means the aircraft will fly fairly slow allowing easier targeting.
