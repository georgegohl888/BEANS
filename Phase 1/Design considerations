intro

An important part of any airborne project is the aircraft itself. Without it it is little more than a pile of wires and circuit boards.

Design considerations

Before I started to crack on an make the thing I need tome idea of what i needed to make. A standard tin of beans weighs in at a 
whopping 415 grams so careful planning needs to be done to ensure the thing will get of the ground. 

Wingspan

It was decided to to use a wingspan of just under 2 meters. This large wingspan means we have the neccicary lift to carry the payload 
and also gives us natural stability. This large wingspan means the aircraft will fly fairly slow allowing easier targeting. Due to its 
large wingspan it is expected that the wings will detach for easier transport.

Propulsion.

We decided to go with a dual motor configuration. This will gave us plenty of power to propell the aircraft. This also frees up room in 
the fuselage and allows an alternitive yaw control to the rudder.

Tailplane

This element of design perhaps required the most thought. We could go for either the "V" tail design or a conventional design. At this 
stage the most likley choice is the conventional design just for simplicity and stability.

With these design consideration we can now design and build the platform.
